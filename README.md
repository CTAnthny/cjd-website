# CJD Website

After discussion, we came to the conclusion that *this is a Charlotte Junior Devs focused website*

### Purpose
  * Showcase who the group is and what we are about
  * Point the way to slack
  * Serve as a central hub to link current and future content


### Main Page

1. The initial build will be a *single-page application*
2. Primary Content
    * Slack link section
    * Meetup events calendar (use meetup api)
3. User sections 
    * Short text descriptions (see note below) about the types of people who would get value from the group
      1. Working Devs
      2. Job-seeking Devs
      3. Learning-path Devs
      4. Mentors
4. Mission statement and purpose
5. Sponsor attribution
6. Links to current / future content
    * Github Dev Survival Guide
    * Code Cred

\** Note on design decisions: The website is planned to evolve and the initial build will be static, while more dynamic content will be added later (see more below)
\* At least initially, dynamic apps and content will be “linked” off from the main static page

### Future Content Ideas

**Dynamic Apps**
* Mentor pairing
* Job seekers portfolios and gallery
* Volunteer / project management
* Blogs

**Other**
* Forum (DO & Discourse) - perma-storage content suggestion
* Feedback / Suggestion submission form
* Pair Programming link-ups
* Slack Channels Directory
